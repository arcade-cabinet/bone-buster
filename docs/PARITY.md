# DOOM reference clone parity audit

Source: [`reference-codebases/js13k2019-yet-another-doom-clone/`](https://github.com/carlini/js13k2019-yet-another-doom-clone)
(read-only, gitignored locally; lives at
`~/src/reference-codebases/js13k2019-yet-another-doom-clone/`).

BONE BUSTER is a port of the reference's STRUCTURE — sector-portal
rendering, key-and-door progression, lava damage, ammo + weapon
swap — onto modern tech (Vite + r3f + Capacitor) elevated with real
3DPSX assets and a horror-tactical visual language. This doc tracks
every reference mechanic and whether BONE BUSTER matches it.

## Legend

- **✅ Present** — BONE BUSTER ships the same behavior or a stricter
  superset. No work needed.
- **🚀 Elevated** — BONE BUSTER ships a more capable version (more
  weapons, richer assets, deeper audio, etc).
- **⚠️ Partial** — Behavior exists but with caveats (different
  formula, missing edge case, etc).
- **❌ Missing** — Reference has it, BONE BUSTER doesn't, **bug**.

## Outstanding gaps (failures to fix)

1. ⚠️ **Test 5 visual quality** — `mission-complete.png` currently captures mid-transition (the loop ran out of debug-hook stability before reaching the actual WIN overlay). Re-record after the next visual change lands.

All reference-clone mechanics are now matched or elevated — including
shell ejection (PA9b shipped). The parity-reached banner at the top
fully stands.

## Elevation queue (beyond parity)

Tracked in [`ELEVATION.md`](./ELEVATION.md) with full specs in
[`PRD.md`](./PRD.md). Remaining work (Phase 1 complete):

- **Phase 2 (mechanical):** E5 destructible barrels, E6 switches + secret walls
- **Phase 3 (visual):** E2 bosses, E3 decorative scatter, E4 lit lamps with shadow projection
- **Phase 4 (polish + variety):** E7 water/sewer biome, E8 flamethrower weapon, E10 3D HUD elements, E11 per-level ambient SFX layers, E13 procedural archetype deepening

Shipped this branch: E1 melee, E9 sql.js run history, E12 adaptive
resolution. Phase 1 of elevation queue complete.

## Verification

`pnpm test` and `pnpm test:e2e:screenshots` capture the canonical 5
poses. Visual parity is judged against the reference by side-by-side
inspection of the screenshots (reference's `image_large.png` lives
in `~/src/reference-codebases/js13k2019-yet-another-doom-clone/`).
