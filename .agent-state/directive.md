# Bone Buster — live work queue

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Branch:** `overhaul/bone-buster` — one long-running branch holds every commit until the queue drains.
**Authority chain:** DESIGN > ARCHITECTURE > DECISIONS > **PRD** > this file > ROADMAP.
**Spec:** [`docs/PRD.md`](../docs/PRD.md) carries the user stories, surfaces, and acceptance bars. Each item below points at its PRD section for the why and the verifiable acceptance.
**Standards:** [`STANDARDS.md`](../STANDARDS.md) carries doctrine (quality bar, slot architecture, no-end-of-turn, design tokens, etc).
**Decisions:** [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](../docs/DECISIONS.md) carries binding technical decisions.
**Audit trail:** shipped items live in `git log` + `.agent-state/decisions.ndjson` + `CHANGELOG.md`. They are not preserved in this file.

## Operating loop

1. Pick the topmost unchecked item.
2. Read its PRD section for the acceptance bar.
3. Implement, run `pnpm verify`, commit, dispatch reviewer trio locally.
4. Fold reviewer findings into the next forward commit.
5. Flip `[ ]` → `[x]` in the same commit; **delete the item from this file** in the next forward-going commit (per the prune-shipped-from-directive rule).
6. Push + open one PR per coherent slice (lane completion or larger), not per commit (per the no-pr-per-commit rule).

## Lane ordering (corrected 2026-05-16)

Foundation → assets → surface. The original ITCH-FETCH-first / REBRAND-first ordering forced double-work because new components landed in the old `src/BoneBuster*.tsx` shape that RESTRUCTURE will move. Going forward:

1. **BUILD-CONFIG** — Vite/Vitest/Pages alignment. Get the deployed gh-pages target green.
2. **RESTRUCTURE** — adopt `app/` + `src/` layout; drop project-name prefix on filenames. Migrate every shipped component (`BoneBusterWordmark`, `ScuffShader`, `audio/logoSting.ts`, `OBJEXOOM*` → `Shell/Hud/Landing/Scene`) in one mechanical pass.
3. **AUDIO** — Howler.js swap + sample integration. Replaces all Tone.js procedural-synth surface. Depends on ITCH-FETCH (shipped) + RESTRUCTURE.
4. **REBRAND** (R6-R10) — remaining rebrand items. R6 logo sting becomes sampled OGG via Howler (re-scoped).
5. **IDENTITY** — depends on REBRAND palette + ITCH-FETCH extracts.
6. **ARCHETYPE INTERLEAVE** — per-archetype content + perf. Depends on everything above.
7. **MIGRATE** — old-repo Pages redirect + 30-day archive. Parallel residual.

## Queue

### IDENTITY — gameplay-design depth

- [ ] **D6** — weapon vs enemy vulnerability tags. PRD §D6.
- [ ] **D8** — alliterative level-name generator. PRD §D8.
- [ ] **D9** — `references/` weapon promotions. PRD §D9.

### ARCHETYPE INTERLEAVE — per-archetype content + perf slice

Order: corridor → arena → courtyard → sewer → library. First slice generalizes the `InstancedField` + `EphemeralPool` factories; subsequent slices reuse.

- [ ] **CORRIDOR** — D7-corridor + A1-corridor + A2-corridor. PRD §ARCHETYPE INTERLEAVE.
- [ ] **ARENA** — D7-arena + A1-arena + A2-arena. PRD §ARCHETYPE INTERLEAVE.
- [ ] **COURTYARD** — D7-courtyard + A1-courtyard + A2-courtyard. PRD §ARCHETYPE INTERLEAVE.
- [ ] **SEWER** — D7-sewer + A1-sewer + A2-sewer. PRD §ARCHETYPE INTERLEAVE.
- [ ] **LIBRARY** — D7-library + A1-library + A2-library. PRD §ARCHETYPE INTERLEAVE.

### MIGRATE — final residual

- [ ] **M4** — OLD repo Pages redirect to new home. PRD §M4.
- [ ] **M5** — 30-day archive grace + `gh repo archive`. PRD §M5.
